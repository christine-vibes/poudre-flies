  "reportText": "@ Canyon Mouth , 29 cfs @ Fort Collins , 2 cfs @ North Fork below Seaman Reservoir The weather definitely took a turn for colder and precipitation is forecasted! We will see some ice build back up in the higher portions of the canyon, but there should still be fishable water in the lower stretches. Check out the town sections near Watson Lake and Lions Open Space. These spots in town have been fishing very well with the sustained flows as of late. Cold water temperatures will keep our bug diversity and size down. Wherever you head in the Fort Collins area to fish, bugs will be small. Sz 20-24 Midge and Baetis patterns. Try a Jujubee Midge or a Mayhem Midge! Dare we say keep an eye for the midge hatches and maybe some BWO's. Check out a Charlie Craven's Mole Fly, or Shucking Midge to fool those trout that are sipping! Spring is on the way whether we like it or not... So make sure your Baetis box is ready. Check out our BWO Tying Class to get your box filled up! Check out our Poudre Assortment of bugs, nice Gateway assortment for the time. HERE! If you are looking for some help in this time to find fishable water or how to fish this technical stuff, come see us at either shop!",
