  "reportText": "@ Canyon Mouth , 20 cfs @ Fort Collins , 6 cfs @ North Fork below Seaman Reservoir There is still ice in the canyon, however there are many fishable spots! Between Picnic Rock and the Mish will have open water, and as you drive up past the Narrows you will once again find more open pockets of water even as high as the hatchery. The weather looks to get a little colder with some much needed precipitation, over the next week. We may see some ice build back up in the higher portions of the canyon, but there should still be plenty to fish in the lower stretches. Check out the town sections near Watson Lake and Lions Open Space. These spots in town have been fishing very well with the sustained flows as of late. Cold water temperatures will keep our bug diversity and size down. Wherever you head in the Fort Collins area to fish, bugs will be small. Sz 20-24 Midge and Baetis patterns. Try a Jujubee Midge or a Mayhem Midge! Dare we say keep an eye for the midge hatches and maybe some BWO's. Check out a Charlie Craven's Mole Fly, or Shucking Midge to fool those trout that are sipping! Spring is on the way whether we like it or not... So make sure your Baetis box is ready. Check out our BWO Tying Class to get your box filled up! Check out our Poudre Assortment of bugs, nice Gateway assortment for the time. HERE! If you are looking for some help in this time to find fishable water or how to fish this technical stuff, come see us at either shop!",
