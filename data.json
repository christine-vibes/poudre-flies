  "reportText": "@ Canyon Mouth , 25 cfs @ Fort Collins , 2 cfs @ North Fork below Seaman Reservoir This week brings some much needed cooler temperatures, and both the town and canyon sections of the Poudre have started to ice over. There is still some fishable water, just be sure to look for moving water where the ice is less likely to build up. Small midge and baetis patterns have been the ticket for us here in the shop. Early in the morning we recommend nymphing underneath an indicator, but keep an eye out for some dry fly action as the temps start to warm up. Flows in Gateway have stayed consistent over the past few weeks. This stretch will stay open throughout the winter as it is a tailwater. Should the flows bump above 10 it can make for some awesome fishing. Town still has some flow, but there are some ice chunks here and there in the slower sections of the river. If the inconsistent weather is too much for you, you can switch into tying mode and get creative! Check out our Intro to Fly Tying Class if tying is new to you! Check out our Poudre Assortment of bugs, nice Gateway assortment for the time! HERE! If you are looking for some help at this time to find fishable water or how to fish this technical stuff, come see us at either shop!",
